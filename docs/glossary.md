## A
{: #glossa}


### AWT font subsystem
{: #x10447151}

The Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) package in Java that is used to create graphical user interface applications. It contains classes that help to implement common windows-based tasks, such as adding scroll bars, buttons, list items, and text boxes.

## C
{: #glossc}


### cryptographic acclerator
{: #x10447156}

The use of hardware to run cryptographic operations to improve performance.

## D
{: #glossd}


### dump
{: #x2021514}

A capture of storage information at the time of an error.

### dynamic logical partitioning
{: #x10447168}

Partitioning with the capability to logically attach and detach a managed system's resources to and from a logical partition's operating system without rebooting.

## H
{: #glossh}


### heap dump
{: #x2788665}

A dump that shows the content of the Java heap.

### heuristic
{: #x2085115}

A problem-solving method or algorithm used to derive a workable solution in within a reasonable time.

### huge page
{: #x4550512}

In Linux, a block of memory that can be 2 MB or 1 GB in size. Using huge pages increases the kernel-level performance by creating fewer pages and therefore fewer mapping tables that the kernel has to load.

## J
{: #glossj}


### Java dump
{: #x8172135}

A dump that contains information from the Java application, such as the operating environment, locks, threads, hooks, shared classes, and class loaders.

## L
{: #glossl}


### large page
{: #x10447162}

In Windows, a block of memory that can be 2 MB or 1 GB in size.

### logical partition (LP,LPAR)
{: #x2002959}

A function of an operating system that creates segments of resources that can be run on copies, or instances, of the operating system and associated applications.

### LP
{: #x2029334}
See [logical partition](#x2002959).


### LPAR
{: #x2029338}
See [logical partition](#x2002959).


## O
{: #glosso}


### OpenSSL
{: #x10447142}

An open source version of the SSL and TLS security protocols, which provide encryption and server authentication over the internet.

## P
{: #glossp}


### page
{: #x2003565}

A block of memory that equals 4096 bytes.

## R
{: #glossr}


### release cadence
{: #x10447137}

The frequency at which new software updates or features are released to users.

## S
{: #glosss}


### SDUMP
{: #x2685105}
See [system dump](#x2095425).


### Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
{: #x2038004}

A security protocol that provides communication privacy. With SSL, client/server applications can communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.

### SSL
{: #x2483907}
See [Secure Sockets Layer](#x2038004).


### system dump (SDUMP)
{: #x2095425}

A dump of all the storage in the system that can be used for problem determination.

## T
{: #glosst}


### THP
{: #x10447179}
See [Transparent Huge Pages](#x10447174).


### TLS
{: #x2041643}
See [Transport Layer Security](#x2069299).


### Transparent Huge Pages (THP)
{: #x10447174}

An abstraction layer that is a Linux kernel feature for automating most parts of creating and managing huge pages.

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)
{: #x2069299}

A set of encryption rules that uses verified certificates and encryption keys to secure communications over the Internet. TLS is an update to the SSL protocol.
