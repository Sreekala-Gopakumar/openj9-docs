- [New binaries and changes to supported environments](#binaries-and-supported-environments)
- [MD5 message digest algorithm support for OpenSSL](#md5-message-digest-algorithm-support-for-openssl)
- [Support added for the `com.sun.management.ThreadMXBean.getTotalThreadAllocatedBytes()` API](#support-added-for-the-comsunmanagementthreadmxbeangettotalthreadallocatedbytes-api)

- [New `-XX:[+|-]EnableExtendedHCR` option added](#new-xx-enableextendedhcr-option-added)

## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; release 0.46.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, 17, 21, and 22.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### MD5 message digest algorithm support for OpenSSL

OpenSSL native cryptographic support is added for the MD5 message digest algorithm, providing improved cryptographic performance. OpenSSL support is enabled by default. If you want to turn off support for the MD5 message digest algorithm, set the [`-Djdk.nativedigest`](djdknativedigest.md) system property to `false`.

### Support added for the `com.sun.management.ThreadMXBean.getTotalThreadAllocatedBytes()` API

With this release, the OpenJ9 VM implementation supports measurement of the total memory allocation for all threads (`com.sun.management.ThreadMXBean.getTotalThreadAllocatedBytes()` API).

The `getTotalThreadAllocatedBytes()` method now returns the total thread allocated bytes instead of `-1`.

### The JITServer AOT caching feature enabled by default at the JITServer server

`-XX:+JITServerUseAOTCache` is the default setting at the JITServer server now. That means that you don't have to specify the `-XX:+JITServerUseAOTCache` option at the server to enable the JITServer AOT caching feature.

Although this option is by default enabled at the server, it is still disabled for the JITServer clients. The clients that want to use the JITServer AOT caching, must still specify the `-XX:+JITServerUseAOTCache` option on the command line. Also, now the clients don't have to enable the [shared classes cache](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/shrc/) feature to use the `-XX:+JITServerUseAOTCache` option.

For more information, see [ `-XX:[+|-]JITServerUseAOTCache`](xxjitserveruseaotcache.md).

### New `-XX:[+|-]EnableExtendedHCR` option added

By default, the extended Hot Code Replace (HCR) capability in the VM is disabled for all OpenJDK versions. You can enable or disable the HCR capability by using the [`-XX:[+|-]EnableExtendedHCR`](xxenableextendedhcr.md) option.

The extended HCR feature is deprecated in this release and will be removed in a future release. From OpenJDK 25 onwards, extended HCR will not be supported. Following that, the extended HCR support will be removed from other earlier OpenJDK versions also.

## Known problems and full release information
